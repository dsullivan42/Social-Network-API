# Social-Network-API
With this activity, we create a model for user, thoughts, and reactions. When accessing the program via Insomnia, we are able to create users, find all users, find users by id, update users, and delete users. Each user has an id, a username, an email, an array for thoughts, an array for friends, and a count for the amount of friends.
For thoughts, we are able to create a though, get all thoughts, get a single thought by id, update a thought, and delete a thought. From these thoughts we are also able to create a reaction or delete a reaction.
Each user is able to add and remove friends from their friend's list. 
There are parameters set, and alerts for when those parameters aren't met for each of the models.
